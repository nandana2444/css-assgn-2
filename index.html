                <p class="Rass">Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me<br>
                    "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"<br>
                    Once, I was seven years old<br>
                </p>
                <p>                    
                    It was a big-big world, but we thought we were bigger<br>
                    Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
                    By 11, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br>
                    Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure<br>
                </p>
                <p class="nev">    
                    Once, I was 11 years old, my daddy told me<br>
                    "Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"<br>
                    Once, I was 11 years old<br>
                    I always had that dream like my daddy before me<br>
                    So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br>
                    Something about the glory just always seemed to bore me<br>
                    'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me <br>
                </p>    
        
                <p class="font">    
                    Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
                    Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>
                    Once, I was 20 years old<br>
                    (Lukas Graham!)<br>
                    I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure<br>
                    'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major<br>
                    I got my boys with me, at least those in favor<br>
                    And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you late<br>
                </p>

                    Once, I was 20 years old, my story got told<br>
                    I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me<br>
                    Once, I was 20 years old<br>
                    Soon, we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold<br>
                    We've traveled around the world, and we're still roaming<br>
                    Soon, we'll be 30 years old<br>
                </p>
                <p class="jeep">
                    I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me<br>
                    So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories<br>
                    Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory<br>
                    And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry<br>
                    Soon, I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61<br>
                    Remember life and then your life becomes a better one<br>
                    I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once<br>
                    I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month<br>
                </p>

                    Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?<br>
                    Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?<br>
                    Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br>
                    Soon, I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold?<br>
                    Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?<br>
                    Soon, I'll be 60 years old<br>
